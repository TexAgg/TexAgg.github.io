	<p id='about_txt'>
		I am a sophomore studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics
		at Texas A&M.
		I am fascinated by the close connection between mathematics and computer science,
		especially mathematical algorithms.
		I mostly program in C++, JavaScript, and R, but I have recently been doing a lot with Mathematica and C#.
